What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a .git folder to the folder you are currently in. It will then allow the use of repository commands in the said folder (e.g. git status, git log, etc). I need to initialize a repository so that we can track changes to the files inside of that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle ground between the working directory and the repository. It allows the user to control which changes to the files will be recorded in the repository.
